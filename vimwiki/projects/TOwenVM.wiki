== Tod Ownen VM Migration ==

* Resources
	* Mentioned about 300GB of DB storage, we aren't sure on the other specs of this machine. 
* Just Migrating or managing
	* Seem to be just migrating

At this point it seems like we will just be migrating this. I will be working with Whit on the new server check list. 

If we end up managing the application we would like a 90 day retention in the DB with the rest being moved to warm storage.
