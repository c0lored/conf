	* Get External DNS & Firewall rules for https://secureftp.liberty.edu
	* Confirm with Johnny that we can begin the transition of FTP accounts

Michaela will be sending over a spreadsheet detailing the accounts. 
We want to convert as many local accounts possible to AD accounts. 
Any account that uses an SSH key will *have* to be local 

We want to start the migration with ITIMO, and the School of Music, maybe Broadcast operations as well.
