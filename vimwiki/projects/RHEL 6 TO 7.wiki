We are going to go with an inplace upgrade for the licensing server, because it went well
for CESMTP it will be a rebuild. I have isolated the postfix config files and have a local copy of them. I have also discovered that filebeat is on these boxes. 

List of localfiles

* /etc/postfix
* /etc/nsswitch.conf
* /etc/opendkim
* /etc/opendkim.conf
* opendkim user
* /etc/filebeat
